#  Stud Sorter UI â€” MVP

Welcome to the MVP version of the **Stud Sorter UI**. This web interface is the first step toward a fully automated LEGO sorting machine. The MVP focuses on a simple but functional frontend that captures images of LEGO parts using a webcam, sends them to the Brickognize API for identification, and displays the results in a user-friendly format.

## ðŸš€ MVP Goals

- Access the user's webcam and capture a still image of a LEGO part.
- Send the image to the [Brickognize API](https://brickognize.com) for part identification.
- Display the result, including part name, ID, and image.
- Provide a clean, responsive UI that will later integrate with backend sorting logic.
